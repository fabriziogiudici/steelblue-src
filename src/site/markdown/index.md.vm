#[[##]]# Introduction

${project.description}

SteelBlue benefits are:

+ clean separation between UI technology and the rest of the application
+ capability of fully testing the presentation model and related interactions without using test tools specific to the UI technology
+ capability of reusing the same application core with multiple UI technologies


#[[##]]# Table of contents

<!-- MACRO{toc|section=0|fromDepth=1|toDepth=4} -->


#[[###]]# Quick introduction to DCI and `As`

TBD



#[[##]]# Getting started

The application is partitioned in the following modules:

+ **Model**: contains data entities and business controllers to elaborate them.
+ **PresentationModel**: TBD
+ **Presentation**: contains the description of the user's interaction and presentation controllers.
+ **JavaFX implementation**: the only module containing objects from the specific UI technology (JavaFX).


#[[###]]# Model

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-model/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/model/package.svg)

Let's introduce a bunch of model classes. First, a very simple one, a plain POJO with constructor and getters.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=entity|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Model/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/model/SimpleEntity.java} -->

Then a slightly more complex entity, with three attributes and `As` capability and a pre-provided `Displayable` role.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=entity|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Model/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/model/SimpleDciEntity.java} -->

Then a more complex entity, which in addition to attributes also acts as a **dynamic composite**. A composite object is one that contains sub-objects; it can
be **static** if the capability is wired in the code, that is all instances of that class share the role. A **dynamic** one doesn't have the capability baked
in the class, but implements it by composition; in this way, some instances can have it, others not. In this case, the condition for being a composite is
to be a directory.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=constructor|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Model/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/model/FileEntity.java} -->

> TODO: the whole listing of FileEntity is too much; either enumerate methods or just provide an UML diagram.

At last, a DAO provides collections of such objects.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=dao|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Model/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/model/Dao.java} -->

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-model/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/model/package.svg)

#[[###]]# Presentation

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-presentation/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/package.svg)

#[[####]]# MainPanelPresentation

This interface is *not implemented* in the backend, but it will in specific implementations related to a UI technology (such as JavaFX). Nevertheless
it can be mocked and used in tests.

#[[####]]# DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-presentation/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.svg)

First, the control must inject the related presentation and the DAOs:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=injections|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

Simple interactions with the user are modelled by `UserAction`s. They at least must be related to a callback method and a `Displayable` that provides the label.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=userActions|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

> As it can be seen in the code, a few actions are also related to a `MenuPlacement` role: this has to do with the creation of the application menu, that will
> be described below. Anyway, in short, they are declaring under which main menu element they should be placed (`File` or `Tools`).

After all the `UserAction`s have been created, they must be packed together into a `Bindings` object. This is usually an inner class of the presentation (it
is not a requirement; it can be a standard class as well); it
is convenient to use the builder pattern for improved code readability (in the code below the `Builder` annotation from Lombok is used).
Note that it can contain instances of `BoundProperties`: they are values that are rendered by the presentation, and can be just modified by the control;
thanks to a listener, the presentation will automatically update them. It is an alternate approach to call a `notify()` method on the presentation.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=bindings|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/MainPanelPresentation.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=bindings|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

Simple actions requiring no further user interaction usually are a call to the presentation for displaying something. In addition, they can change a status
local to the control (`status`) or modify a `BoundProperty`.

> While `BoundProperty` instances can be of any type, it's advisable they are all `String` and formatted by the control. This favours reuse and facilitates
testing.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onButtonPressed|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

When a confirmation is required from the user, a `notificationWithFeedback()` object can be used. Mandatory attributes are a caption and a text, as well as a
callback that will be executed when the Ok button is pressed. The callback can be a request to display something in the presentation, or eventually start a
more complex computation.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onButtonDialogOkPressed|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

A variant is allowed when the user might cancel the action, providing an alternate callback.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onButtonDialogOkCancelPressed|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

User interaction that possibly return a value can use instances of `BoundProperty`. In the code below, `selectedFile` is used in a bidirectional fashion: both
for setting the starting point from which browsing the filesystem and for retrieving the selection.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onButtonPickFilePressed|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onButtonPickDirectoryPressed|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

When the control is initialized, it must call the presentation to pass the bindings, so the presentation implementation can relate them to the actual UI controls.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=initialization|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

> There are limitations to the use of `@PostConstruct`, that will be explained below.

There must be at least one method to activate the presentation, typically populating it with data. Here we see that `entities1`, `entities2` an `files` are
first retrieved from the DAOs; then presentation models are created and collected into composite presentation models `pm1`, `pm2` and `pm3` . At last,
the presentation models are passed to the presentation.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=populate|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

Each data entity that need to interact with a presentation need to have a presentation model. In the example:

+ the entity can be selected in a list: a `Selectable` role is provided, which calls back the `onSelected()` method.
+ three context actions are created (they will be presented in a contextual menu).
+ at last, the presentation model will be rendered with the entity name.

The entity can be:

+ a simple POJO, such as in this case;
+ an object with associated DCI roles (i.e. it implements the `As` interface): in this case, all the roles such as `UserActionProvider`, `Selectable` etc...
will be automatically part of the presentation model.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=pmSimpleEntity|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

Callbacks need one parameter, which is the object the action must be performed on.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onSelected|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=action1|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

In this second example, an `Aggregate` role is also provided.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=pmSimpleDciEntity|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->


#[[####]]# FileEntityPresentable

Presentation models can be created in various way:

1. associated to an entity class already in the model;
2. explicitly created in a presentation control, as shown above (this works for POJOs);
3. create in a specific `Presentable` role, that acts as a presentation model factory.

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-presentation/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/FileEntityPresentable.svg)

The `Presentable` approach is the recommended one (unless the entity is very simple) since in practice the runtime will ask each entity to create is
presentation model. In particular this is important for composite entities, unless one wants to write code that recursively navigate the tree of child
entities; a task that would be cumbersome to implement in case of heterogeneous composites.

For the entity `FileEntity` the `Presentable` approach has been provided. It uses an `Aggregate` role, required when the entity is going to be presented
in a UI control with columns (such as a table or a tree-table). The aggregate provides multiple presentation model instances, one for each column.

> The `r()` method is a simple utility method that accepts varargs arguments and pack them into a `Collection`, eventually expanding arguments that are
> `Collection`s themselves.
> The `_s()` method is a simple utility method that wraps a method whose functional signature is similar to the one of a `Supplier`, but can throw a checked
> exception: it returns a `Supplier` with no checked exceptions.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=all|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/FileEntityPresentable.java} -->

Note that since the owner object is mutable (it represents a file, that can change attributes during its life cycle), **deferred** `Displayable`s are used:
instead directly calling the getter methods, they use `Supplier`s.


#[[####]]# Action providers

Sometimes actions do not strictly live inside a presentation/control, but must be bound to global facilities such as toolbars and menu bars. On this purpose,
one or more `UserActionProvider` roles can be instantiated. They can be associated to `ToolBarModel` or `MenuBarModel` or both (as in the example below).

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=all|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/MainPanelUserActionProvider.java} -->

The purpose of this class is to return a list of `UserAction`s that can be instantiated locally or retrieved elsewhere, if they are already available (as in
this case). Note that all actions will be made available to a toolbar, while only those associated with a `MenuPlacement` will be attached to a menu bar.
It is possible to put some logics in the code to decide which actions should be exposed; if the rationale for the toolbar is different than the one for the
menu bar, two separate `UserActionProvider`s must be provided.
Multiple `UserActionProvider`s related to the same target (toolbar or menu bar) can be present, and this is indeed a good design approach as each one should
be related to a different module in the system.


#[[###]]# Testing

Given that this module does not depend on UI technology, testing is easy and can be performed with the usual tools. Below some sketches will be illustrated
that make use of TestNG and Mockito.

First, mocks are created; they are one or more DAOs (or similar classes) and one presentation.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=mocks|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/test/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControlTest.java} -->

Simple button interactions can be tested in a straightforward fashion.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=test_buttonAction|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/test/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControlTest.java} -->

Confirmation dialogs can be tested with a few lines of code, also thanks to helper methods such as `confirm()`.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=test_actionDialogOk_confirm|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/test/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControlTest.java} -->

Also dialog cancellations can be tested in the same way.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=test_actionDialogCancelOk_cancel|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/test/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControlTest.java} -->

More complex interactions such as those with the file picker require a bit more code, but still under the dozen of lines.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=test_actionPickFile_confirm|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/test/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControlTest.java} -->

At last, an example of testing an interaction involving DAOs and composite entities. In this case the test is clearly more complex, but it's due to the fact
that a lot of things are tested, included interactions.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=test_start|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/test/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControlTest.java} -->

> `_c()` is a utility static method that wraps a `Consumer` that can throw a checked exception into a `Consumer` that wraps it into a `RuntimeException`, thus
> being compatible with the `Stream` API without requiring ugly looking `try / catch` blocks.


#[[###]]# JavaFX implementation

The JavaFX implementation of the application must provide:

+ implementations of presentation interfaces (presentation controls doesn't need any further code);
+ JavaFX layout resources (`.fxml` files);
+ a `main()` that starts the application.

Actually there are two implementations for each presentation interface:

+ the actual implementation, called “presentation delegate”
+ a decorator implementation that takes care of threading issues.

The reason for this duplication is that the former class is instantiated by the JavaFX runtime (the class is declared in a `.fxml` resource),
while the latter needs to be instantiated by Spring.

> TODO: mention that threading is automatic. Add in the control description that the reason for which notify methods are always called is bacause of threading.


#[[####]]# JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-presentation-javafx/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.svg)

The presentation delegate is the class referred by the `.fxml` resource associated to the presentation (in this case `MainPanel.fxml`).

<!-- MACRO{snippet|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/resources/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/MainPanel.fxml} -->

This class must first inject the required fields: an instance of the `JavaFXBinder` utility and the references to all the JavaFX widgets in the interface.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=fields|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.java} -->

> Unfortunately it's not possible to inject fields by constructor, since this feature is not supported by the JavaFX runtime.

A `bind()` method, called just once, must use the `binder` to create associations between `UserAction` and `BoundProperty` instances and the JavaFX widgets. Bindings are
by default unidirectional, that is e.g. a button calls a `UserAction`; in some cases, they can be bidirectional, as in the `tfTextField` example, because
changes can be originated both by the code and from the user's interaction.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=bind|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.java} -->

When the control requires to update the rendering of data, it calls a method passing the related presentation models. Again the `binder` makes it possible
to re-associate the rendering widgets with the new data.

> `bind()` accepts an optional callback, that will be called when the binding operation has been completed. This feature is not trivial, because manipulation
of JavaFX widgets always happen in the JavaFX thread, while the callback is executed in a regular thread. In this case, callbacks are used for logging purposes.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=populate|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.java} -->

Some notification methods are very simple, as they just call methods to manipulate the JavaFX widgets.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=notify2|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.java} -->

Notifications and special dialogs are also executed by `binder`.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=notify1|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=pickFile|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.java} -->
<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=pickDirectory|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentationDelegate.java} -->


#[[####]]# JavaFXMainPanelPresentation

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-presentation-javafx/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentation.svg)

The decorator implementation is always created in the same way, as in the following code example. The returned delegate is indeed a dynamic proxy that wraps
all method calls in JavaFX `Platform.runLater()`, thus the programmer need not to take care of threading issues.
The use of Lombok `@Delegate` dramatically simplifies the implementation of this class.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=all|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXMainPanelPresentation.java} -->

The `.fxml` resource by default has the same name of the presentation class, with the words `JavaFX` and `Presentation` removed, and must be in the same
package.

> An overloaded version of the method `createNodeAndDelegate()` allows a second parameter with the full path of the `.fxml` resource


#[[####]]# JavaFXApplicationPresentationDelegate

TBD

![UML](it-tidalwave-steelblue-modules/it-tidalwave-steelblue-examples/it-tidalwave-steelblue-example-presentation-javafx/apidocs/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXApplicationPresentationDelegate.svg)

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=all|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXApplicationPresentationDelegate.java} -->


#[[####]]# Main class

The `main` of the application must call a launch method specifying a bunch of properties, as shown in the following code snippet:


<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=main|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/javafx/Main.java} -->

These properties are mandatory:
+ the application name;
+ the name of a system property that will be set with the path of the log folder and referenced in the logger configuration file.

Optional properties:

+ `K_INITIAL_SIZE`: the initial size of the window, as a percentage of the screen size.
+ `K_FULL_SCREEN`: `true` if the application must start at full screen.
+ `K_FULL_SCREEN_LOCKED`: `true` if the application must stay all the time at full screen.
+ `K_MAXIMIZED`: `true` if the application must start maximized.
+ `K_MIN_SPLASH_DURATION`: the minimum duration of the splash screen.

The method `onStageCreated()` can be used to initialize the control beans.
> `@PostConstruct` annotated methods should be carefully used because of threading issues (see
> [STB-78](https://tidalwave.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/STB/issues/STB-78)). In particular, the `as()` subsystem might not properly be initialised
> when post-initialisers are called. This might cause an exception or even deadlock the application at start.
> Post-constructors are fine when they are just used by a control to talk to the presentation to set bindings.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onStageCreated|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/javafx/Main.java} -->

An alternate way is by using a pubsub facility, as explained in the next section.

Two `fxml` resources must be provided in the same package of the `Main` class:

+ `Application.fxml` describes the layout of the main window
+ `Splash.fxml` describes a splash pop up that will be rendered during the initialisation of the application

It's common to have multiple `.FXML` files, for instance one describing the general layout of the application (e.g. a toolbar at the top, a center
content pane and a bottom status bar) and one specific for each panel in the application. In this case they must be programmatically assembled together.
The proper way to do that is to have the main presentation delegate to implement `PresentationAssembler`: the `assemble()` method will be called back with
the initialized `ApplicationContext`, so the code can retrieve any other presentation and their related `Node`.

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=all|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/javafx/JavaFXApplicationPresentationDelegate.java} -->


#[[#####]]# Pubsub architecture

Instead of exposing public method of controllers, they can be interfaceless and react to events. If the main class is annotated with `@EnableMessageBus` the
following things happen:

+ a messagebus implementing `SimpleMessageBus` is instantiated and made available in the Spring application context (so it can be injected);
+ a `PowerOnEvent` is fired when the application is ready to be initialised;
+ a `PowerOffEvent` is fired when the application is going to be closed.

A controller can be notified about events by writing a simple method with an annotated parameter:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=onPowerOn|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/Presentation/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/impl/DefaultMainPanelPresentationControl.java} -->

> The method can be private, but a package visibility is useful for testing.

WIth this approach, a valid implementation of the message bus must be added to the classpath:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=messagebus|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/pom.xml} -->

Also, AspectJ and Spring AOP are required to make the listener methods discovered and registered.

> If the Tidalwave SuperPOM is used, all the required dependencies can be added by enabling the profile `it.tidalwave-spring-messagebus-v1`.


#[[####]]# Assembling all the code

Since Spring is behind the scene, all the classes must be instantiated with a standard Spring approach. The preferred way nowadays is by using annotations; in
this case the main class must extend `JavaFXSpringAnnotationApplication` and have the following annotations:

<!-- MACRO{snippet|id=annotations|file=${project.basedir}/modules/examples/PresentationJavaFX/src/main/java/it/tidalwave/ui/example/presentation/javafx/Main.java} -->

The beans participating in the example need to be instantiated. In the example code, they are auto-scanned thanks to the Spring `@Component` annotation.

It is also possible — while not recommended — to use the old Spring `.xml` configuration approach: in this case the base class to extend is `JavaFXSpringApplication`.
The classpath is scanned for all the Spring beans files placed under the `META-INF` directory and whose name ends with `AutoBeans.xml`. Furthermore,
specific operating system configuration files are searched for:

+ for Linux, files whose name ends with `AutoLinuxBeans.xml`
+ for macOS, files whose name ends with `AutoMacOSXBeans.xml`
+ for Windows, files whose name ends with `AutoWindowsBeans.xml`
