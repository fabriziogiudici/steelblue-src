SteelBlue
================================

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/tidalwave/steelblue-src/status.png)](https://drone.io/bitbucket.org/tidalwave/steelblue-src/latest)

SteelBlue contains the JavaFX implementation of a set of UI-related DCI roles defined in the project
TheseFoolishThings. It allows to design rich client applications in a fashion that is mostly independent of the
UI technology so the code depending on it is segregated in a confined section.
